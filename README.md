Existing LIC Database system do not provide facility to select the particular policy by going through each policy details. Customers has to be dependent on agent to get details on particular policy. While taking any particular policy, customers do not able to get information what will be the minimum installment to be made and in what mode. Agent are also not able to check their account any time as per their requirement and the details of customers who have taken policy from them along with their policy maturity date. The present system do not provide the correct medium for the agents to know their commissions which has been made while selling any particular policy. Also the present system do not uses the concept of OOPâ€™S by which changes can be made easily to any particular section within the program code easily.
